   About:
     The Europeana Foundation is the operator of the 
     Europeana service, including the search portal at 
     Europeana.eu and related data services such as the 
     Europeana Application Programming Interface (API) 
     and the Linked Open Data pilot. The Foundation is 
     governed by an Executive Committee and Board, and 
     employs full-time and part-time staff.

     The Europeana Network is an open, expert forum 
     comprising content holders and aggregators along 
     with providers of technical, legal and strategic 
     knowledge.

     Our services are under constant development by 
     content and technology projects, collectively 
     referred to as the Europeana project group.

     What We Do
     ----------

     Aggregate – We are building the open, trusted source 
                 for European cultural content.

     Facilitate – We support the cultural heritage sector 
                  through knowledge transfer, innovation and 
                  advocacy.

     Distribute – We make heritage available to people wherever 
                  they are, whenever they want it.

     Engage – We cultivate new ways for people to participate 
              in their cultural heritage.
